This is a demo github app.

It currently has one feature, the ability to comment on a new issue when opened.

You can create you own app using this base line.

The config.sample is the basis for a config directory which has secrets and config information. Fill that in with the app info.
The index install URL is pointing to the install  url for this app. Change that to your own apps install URL.

You can run local dev using sh dev.sh .
You will been to have github reach the callback URL so you can use ngrok or other forwarders to hook the app to your local machine.
